# TODO

- ~~Tags are still broken as shit.~~

- `.determinate` needs a whole overhaul.

- ~~Make a proper close instead of having to use debug.~~

- First time setup?

- ~~Tags should autocreate on first run.~~

- ~~OH BOY GET READY FOR OFFICIAL API BECAUSE THAT'S GONNA BREAK A LOOOOOOOOOOT~~

- `.later` should fall back to Imgur uploaded versions of the images if the bot can't upload files.

- ~~Don't deprecate `.changes`, Read the latest commits and post a link to the GitHub instead~~

- ~~Remove `.welcome`. Instead, post a simple introductory prompt when CB is mentioned.~~

- Ok fuck Wiktionary, go check if Reference.com has an API and if not start scraping from it.

 - Reference.com does not have an API. FFs.

- ~~`.log` should delete the log invoker?~~

- ~~`.changes` shouldn't show minors. That was a bad idea.~~

- Some system to log user joins and leaves, either publically or privately.

- `.export [ tags | quotes ]` and `.import`: allowing bots to update their tags from the master.

- Deprecate tags.

- Alias `.choice` with `.choose`, `.decide`, and `.c`

- Create long alias for `.d` as `.dice`

- Add help information for pre and postcommands.

- Add a toggle function to disable cacommands and postcommands.

- The 4chan parser should use the API instead of scraping.

- Replace `.limbo` and `.forebode` with a full bot rolebanning command.

 - Add unrolebanning command.

- ~~BUG: Commands can be invoked even if there's a space between the invoker and the command.~~

- Make a website for describing CacoBot commands in more detail because if stuff goes right some of these commands will end up being rather complicated.

## Low Priority

- `.cahsim`, which can either create a random winning Cards Against Humanity pair, or start a single round of CaH with users (by PMing them white cards.)

- `.cipher` to encode and decode ciphers.

- YOU HAVE A BIG LIST OF ASGORE NAMES YOU BITCH ADD THEM

- bring back CacoRadio!

 - Partially in progress. Some tentative radio functions have been added.

- https://github.com/Orangestar12/cacobot/pull/12

- You still need to add Quake obits to `.kill` and `.rip`
