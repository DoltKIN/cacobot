# TODO

 ~~- Tags are still broken as shit.~~

 - `.determinate` needs a whole overhaul.

 ~~- Make a proper close instead of having to use debug.~~

 - First time setup?

 - Tags should autocreate on first run.

 - OH BOY GET READY FOR OFFICIAL API BECAUSE THAT'S GONNA BREAK A LOOOOOOOOOOT

 - `.later` should fall back to Imgur uploaded versions of the images if the bot can't upload files.

 ~~- Don't deprecate `.changes`, Read the latest commits and post a link to the GitHub instead~~

 ~~- Remove `.welcome`. Instead, post a simple introductory prompt when CB is mentioned.~~

 - Ok fuck Wiktionary, go check if Reference.com has an API and if not start scraping from it.

 - `.log` should delete the log invoker?

## Low Priority

 - `.cahsim`, which can either create a random winning Cards Against Humanity  pair, or start a single round of CaH with users (by PMing them white cards.)

 - `.cipher` to encode and decode ciphers.

 - SOMETHING ELSE BUT I FORGOT IT RIP

 - bring back CacoRadio!
