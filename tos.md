# CacoBot Terms of Service

These are the terms of service for the Discord automated response robot known as CacoBot, hereafter referred simply as CacoBot. This document implies the following:

* All references to "You", et al, in this document refer to the person who has submitted a command to the robot.
* All references to "Me", "I", etc., in this document refer to the bot maintainer, Daniel "Orangestar" O'Day.
* All references to "The bot", "CacoBot", et al, and many references to "It", refer to the currently-running robot in question. (CacoBot, user id 98900092924215296.)

**By using any commands associated with CacoBot, you agree to all of the terms in this agreement.**

## Prelude

**[IANAL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IANAL "I am not a lawyer")**. This terms of service is written extremely informally, and many inclusions in this page may be written vaguely, inefficiently, or just plain incorrectly. If you have any further questions about using CacoBot, feel free to join [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/0iLJFytdVRBR1vgh) and talk to me directly.

These terms of service apply to the *base* CacoBot, currently maintained by me and residing chiefly in CacoServer (link above). If you still wish to use CacoBot, but do not wish to agree to the terms of service here, you are completely free to host your own copy of CacoBot with your own rules.

**Important bits are in bold, so if you just want to skim, look for the bold.** However, you really should set aside some time to read the whole thing.

## What you can do.

As a user of CacoBot, you may use any and all commands made available to you. Any commands you are not allowed to use should be made inaccessible to you programmatically. Any restrictions placed on you regarding CacoBot's commands are at the jurisdiction of your server administrator.

In short, **You are given full permission to utilize every CacoBot command as per the terms of this agreement.** Server restrictions may apply.

**You are also given full permission to store as much data as you request on CacoBot.** Be this tags, quotes, or whatever. There is a caveat to this, and I urge you to continue reading.

## What *I* can do.

As the owner and maintainer of CacoBot, I retain some rights about what I can do about the data received by CacoBot.

1. **I retain the right to sign in through CacoBot and view any server he is connected to.** This means that I will, occasionally (usually to perform maintenance) sign into the Discord client as CacoBot. Usually what I do with CacoBot isn't too intrusive, but I'm putting this here to cover my ass because people complained about this last time.

2. **I retain the right to completely restrict your usage of CacoBot through the global plug command, at any time.** This is usually restricted to other bots to prevent CacoBot from doing commands spurred by them from other users, but just know that if you're being enough of a nuisance, I can kick you out of CacoBot.

3. **Any data you input into CacoBot at any time is stored on** ***my*** **hardware and** ***my*** **user account on** ***my*** **terms, and may be stored, saved, deleted, edited, or posted elsewhere, without your consent.** This includes quotes added to the `.quote/.addquote` command, tags added through the `.tag` command, your user ID (as posted via `.tag`, `.memo`, etc.), or any servers you ask CacoBot to connect to.

This is not in malice: I respect how tentative other users are of their privacy, and am willing to remove content from CacoBot on request. Simply speak to me (Orangestar, id 88401933936640000) and let me know, or delete them yourself using any of the delete commands (`.tag delete, .delquote, etc.`)

4. **You will refrain from attempting to disable the bot in any way. You will refrain from purposefully causing errors. You will refrain from making CacoBot a nuisance to any server he is in or to any administration in any server he is in.** This includes causing errors purposefully, attempting to spam CacoBot in an area where spamming is prohibited, attempting to disable the server running CacoBot with (D)DOS attacks and other unregulated internet tomfoolery, causing "bot chains" with other bots consistently entering commands into each other, and other generally uncouth actions. In short, don't be a dick with the bot.

5. **I maintain the ability to update or nullify any or every term in this agreement.** And, unless you refuse to use the bot, you implicitly agree to these updates as they happen.

I'm sorry for sounding all scary about this, but thanks for reading the whole thing! Now go out there and do awesome things with CacoBot.
